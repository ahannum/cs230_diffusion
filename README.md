# cs230_diffusion

Diffusion-weighted Imaging (DWI) is an MRI technique that maps the diffusion process of molecules to 
microstructure in biological tissue, which is limited by image resolution and the data size. Here, 
we utilized a deep learning model to infer fractional anisotropy maps from few diffusion weighted images.

This repository contains the models that were trained and Jupyter Notebooks for evaluating the models. 

This project was the final course project for CS230: Deep Learning, at Stanford University, Fall 2022. The project
was an "Outstanding Project" for the course during the quarter: http://cs230.stanford.edu/past-projects/
